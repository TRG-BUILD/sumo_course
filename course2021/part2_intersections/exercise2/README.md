## Exercise 2
- Model an road in Aalborg with a sequence of coordinated traffic lights
- Generate meaningful demand using `randomTrips.py` with weighted edges
- Calculate the optimal TLS time using `tools`
- Decide on couple of coordination offsets, simulate the results with output and compare the results using `tools`
- Calculate the optimal offset time using `tools`
