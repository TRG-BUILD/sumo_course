# SUMO intersections, time / demand controlled

## Before lecture
- Watch and follow along a SUMO video of somebody making a simulation
- something about intersection modelling
- documentation

## Block 1 - lecture part
- recap on the lecture 1
- recap on modelling intersections, connections and priorities, driver behaviours
- recap on 
- recap on vehicle coordination

## Block 1 - practice part
Exercise 0 build time controlled crosswalk

Exercise 1, study and edit a model a time controlled intersection to add a left turn phase from Rasmuses lecture
(Extras for fast) Add a bicycle lane and cyclist demand and see its effect
(Extras for fast) Add pedestrians and see its effect

## Block 2 - lecture part
- Recap on detectors and vehicle controlled intersection

## Block 2 - practice part
Create a corridor and simulate it in 2 different ways
- With vehicle controlled controller
- With fixed time coordination
(Extras for fast) add bicycle lane and pedestrian crossings
