## Exercise 2
- Model an intersection from an assignment with Rasmus
- Generate corresponding demands
- Visualize how the intersection functions witout TLS
- Add a pre-timed TLS to the intersection with your times and generate trips output
- Add a pre-timed TLS with SUMO optimization
- Add detectors to all approaches
- Change pre-timed controller to the traffic actuated controller and generate trips output
- Compare those 2 scenarios using `tools`
